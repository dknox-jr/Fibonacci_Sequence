Coding Fibonacci's Sequence

A classmate of mine was given this problem in an interview:
"Write a program that will generate Fibonacci's Sequence."

To generate the sequence, you take the last two numbers in the list
and add them together to get the next number, and repeat, with the first
2 numbers in the list each being the number 1.

So the sequence is 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, etc... (1+1=2, 2+3=5, ...)

Here are the solutions I came up with:

Fib.py will print a single number.
So if you want the 13th number in the sequence, enter 13 when prompted
and the program will output 233.
This could have been a much shorter program but I broke it down into very
small parts and provided notes.

Fib2.py will print out a list.
So if you want a list of 13 values in the sequence, enter 13 when prompted
and the program will output a list with all values in the Fibonacci Sequence
up to and including 233.
For this program I challenged myself to write it in as few lines and steps as
possible.  There are no notes to preserve the visual elegance of the code.

Enjoy!
